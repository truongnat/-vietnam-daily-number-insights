- `utils/appwrite-database.ts` - Database operations using Appwrite
- `docs/appwrite-schema.md` - Database schema documentation
- `docs/appwrite-setup.md` - Step-by-step setup guide
- `scripts/test-appwrite.js` - Connection test script
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### 3. Files Modified
- `app/api/storage/analysis/[date]/route.ts` - Updated to use Appwrite
- `app/api/storage/lottery/[date]/route.ts` - Updated to use Appwrite
- `app/api/storage/historical/route.ts` - Updated to use Appwrite
- `utils/server-storage.ts` - Updated to use Appwrite functions
- `README.md` - Updated documentation to reflect Appwrite usage
- `package.json` - Added test script
- `.env` - Updated Appwrite endpoint to cloud.appwrite.io

### 4. Environment Variables
Updated `.env` with:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT = "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID = "688dd34f001a80988615"
```

## üîÑ Migration Details

### Database Schema
**Database ID:** `vietnam-insights`

**Collections:**
1. **analyses** - Stores daily analysis data
2. **lottery-results** - Stores lottery results

### API Changes
All API endpoints now use async/await patterns and Appwrite database operations:
- `GET /api/storage/analysis/[date]` - Retrieves analysis from Appwrite
- `POST /api/storage/analysis/[date]` - Saves analysis to Appwrite
- `POST /api/storage/lottery/[date]` - Saves lottery results to Appwrite
- `GET /api/storage/historical` - Retrieves all historical data from Appwrite

### Data Transformation
- Complex objects are serialized to JSON strings for storage
- Date keys (YYYY-MM-DD) are converted to document IDs (YYYYMMDD)
- Timestamps are automatically added for audit trail

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Setup Appwrite Database
Follow the guide in `docs/appwrite-setup.md`:
1. Create database and collections in Appwrite console
2. Configure attributes and indexes
3. Set proper permissions

### 2. Test the Migration
```bash
# Test Appwrite connection
pnpm run test:appwrite

# Build and test the application
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Verify Functionality
1. Check that the application starts without errors
2. Test API endpoints work correctly
3. Verify data is being saved to Appwrite
4. Check Appwrite console for stored documents

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing collections** - Follow setup guide to create required collections
2. **Permission errors** - Ensure collections have proper read/write permissions
3. **Environment variables** - Verify all Appwrite config is correct
4. **Connection errors** - Check project ID and endpoint URL

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test Appwrite connection
pnpm run test:appwrite

# Check for TypeScript errors
pnpm build

# Test API endpoints locally
curl http://localhost:3000/api/storage/historical
```

## üìä Benefits of Migration

### Performance
- **Global CDN** - Appwrite provides global edge locations
- **Scalability** - Cloud database scales automatically
- **Reliability** - Professional database infrastructure

### Development
- **Real-time** - Built-in real-time capabilities
- **Security** - Professional authentication and permissions
- **Monitoring** - Built-in analytics and monitoring

### Maintenance
- **No file system** - No more JSON file management
- **Backup** - Automatic backups and versioning
- **Multi-environment** - Easy staging/production separation

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current Setup
- Public read/write access for simplicity
- Environment variables for configuration

### Production Recommendations
1. **Authentication** - Implement user authentication
2. **API Keys** - Use server-side API keys for write operations
3. **Rate Limiting** - Configure rate limits in Appwrite
4. **Permissions** - Restrict write access to authenticated users

## üìù Legacy Code

The original JSON-based database code remains in `utils/database.ts` for reference but is no longer used. It can be safely removed after confirming the migration is successful.

## ‚ú® Migration Complete!

The application has been successfully migrated from JSON file storage to Appwrite cloud database. All functionality should work the same, but with improved performance, scalability, and reliability.
